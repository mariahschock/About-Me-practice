            </h1>
            <p>Fiercely independent, domesticated cats have coexisted with humans 
                for more than 10.000 years. But, who within this relationship, is 
                truly in charge? <br>
                Some experts may say that the larger beings, the humans, are clearly 
                the ones with all the power. However, these "experts", clearly don't 
                live with the beloved felines themselves. For if they did, they would 
                recognize that it is indeed, the cat who obtains the power. <br>
                It is known that grown cats do not meow at other grown cats to communicate. 
                No, this is something that they developed to communicate with humans...Some may 
                even say, to manipulate humans, especially when it comes to getting something they want.</p>

                                He is what one would call "needy" and has some seperation anxiety. He loves to hug 
                                around the neck and purr louder than a lawn mower when giving cuddles, cries if he gets shut out of the room where mom is, 
                                and will do his most extreme/aggressive cuddling (that involves chewing on fingers) when hungry. <br>

                                He is the reason why food cannot be left on the counters. 
                                When he's hungry, he'll let it be known by licking everthing (the wall, 
                                carpet, someones hair, wine bottles, etc.).As a last resort, he will sit on laps and meow 
                                like an alarm clock until he is fed. TK has also learned that if he walks up 
                                to someone and falls over on his side, he will get pets/scratches.<br>

                                the greatest manipulator of all... Phoebe was a problamatic stray kitten that was brought in 
                                with the goal of finding a new home for her, but as it turned out, she was pregnant. Bada-bing 
                                bada-boom, had kittens, kittens found homes, and Phoebe became apart of the family. She takes 
                                nightly Prozac, attacks her brothers, and screams for food. Phoebe also has some severe jealousy issues. <br>
