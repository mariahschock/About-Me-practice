            </h1>
            <p>Fiercely independent, domesticated cats have coexisted with humans 
                for more than 10.000 years. But, who within this relationship, are 
                truly in charge? <br>
                Some experts may say that the larger beings, the humans, are clearly 
                the ones with all the power. However, these "experts", clearly don't 
                live with the beloved felines themselves. For if they did, they would 
                recognize that is is indeed, the cat who obtains the power. <br>
                It is known that grown cats do not meow at other grown cats to communicate. 
                No, this is something that they developed to communicate with humans...Some may 
                even say, to manipulate humans.</p>
